# ORGA_ORGS Addon Refactoring

## Overview
This document summarizes the modularization of the ORGA_ORGS addon that was completed on March 4, 2025. The goal was to break up the original 1000+ line ORGA_ORGS.lua file into multiple modules for better maintainability.

## Changes Made

### File Structure
- Split the original monolithic `ORGA_ORGS.lua` file into four separate modules:
  - `ORGA_ORGS.lua` - Main file with core functionality and initialization
  - `ORGA_ORGS_Inventory.lua` - Inventory scanning and management
  - `ORGA_ORGS_Cart.lua` - Shopping cart functionality
  - `ORGA_ORGS_UI.lua` - User interface components and rendering

### TOC File
- Updated the `ORGA_ORGS.toc` file to load these files in the correct order

### Functionality Distribution

#### ORGA_ORGS.lua (Core)
- Initialization of global variables
- Debug and utility functions (ORGS_DebugPrint, ORGS_FormatGold)
- Bank alt definitions
- Slash command handlers
- Event handling (PLAYER_LOGIN, BANKFRAME_OPENED)
- Tab registration with main ORGA addon

#### ORGA_ORGS_Inventory.lua
- Bank detection logic (ORGS_IsBankOpen)
- Inventory scanning functionality
- Player bag scanning
- Bank inventory scanning
- Save button integration with bank UI
- Loading inventory data from all bank alts

#### ORGA_ORGS_Cart.lua
- Shopping cart system
- Request submission functionality
- Cart data management

#### ORGA_ORGS_UI.lua
- Main inventory display (ORGS_ShowInventoryUI)
- Gold information display
- Item grid creation and management
- Cart display and management UI
- Request management interface for bank alts

## Benefits
1. **Improved Maintainability**: Each file is now focused on a specific aspect of the addon
2. **Reduced Complexity**: Code is easier to understand when organized by function
3. **Collaborative Development**: Multiple developers can work on different modules
4. **Easier Expansion**: Simpler to add new features or fix issues in targeted areas
5. **Better Organization**: Clear separation of concerns between UI, data, and logic

## Implementation Details
- Maintained all original functionality while restructuring
- Preserved variable names and function signatures for compatibility
- Ensured proper initialization order via the TOC file
- Fixed issues with incorrect file references

## Encountered Issues
- Initially referenced incorrect file name in TOC file (ORGA_ORGS_Core.lua vs ORGA_ORGS.lua)
- Fixed by updating the TOC file to reference the correct main file

## Future Improvements
- Consider categorizing items by type (weapons, armor, consumables, etc.)
- Add filtering options to the UI
- Improve error handling for better robustness
- Add more comprehensive debugging options

## How to Test
1. Launch World of Warcraft
2. Log in with a character
3. Type `/orgs` to open the ORGS inventory window
4. For bank alts, test bank scanning by visiting a banker
5. Test item request functionality through the shopping cart

## Notes
The core functionality has been preserved during this refactoring, with no changes to user experience. The addon should function exactly as before, but with improved code organization and maintainability.
